 Hi Matt! I plan to work on a number of these things (content, layout, responsive elements, the work section) and I also have some places greyed out, incase I want to use/expand on them in the future. I am content with the overall layout except for the tumblr pictures. I found it frustrating to get them into a position that I liked. I would like to go back a refactor some of my code that I used mutiple times(The hovers for example) but overall this final project was a great learning experience. Thank you so much for an amazing class! I learned tons and I am excited to be able to build on these skills.
